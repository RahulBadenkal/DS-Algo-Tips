# DS-Algo-Tips
Tips for doing ds and algo

1. Try sorting and see if that helps solve the problem. See leetcode -> 56. merge-intervals

2. Check if it can be solved by using a simple known data structure like: stack, queue, tree, hashing or lists - See leetcode 735. asteroid-collision

3. Try to see if recursion helps. Try to get the recursive formula like T(n) = T(n-2) + T(n-2), that might also help in thinking of a recursive solution

4. See if divide and conquer helps (ex: mergesort)

5. Assume the input size was 1, Now solve it. Add one to element to it (n=2), now what happens? Solve it. Add one more element (n=3) and solve it. Then generalise it for n elements

6. See if you can apply 2 pointer method (one slow pointer, 1 fast pointer)
